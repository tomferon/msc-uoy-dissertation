	abstract = {This book focuses specifically on the key results in stochastic processes that have become essential for finance practitioners to understand. The authors study the Wiener process and Itô integrals in some detail, with a focus on results needed for the Black–Scholes option pricing model. After developing the required martingale properties of this process, the construction of the integral and the Itô formula (proved in detail) become the centrepiece, both for theory and applications, and to provide concrete examples of stochastic differential equations used in finance. Finally, proofs of the existence, uniqueness and the Markov property of solutions of (general) stochastic equations complete the book. Using careful exposition and detailed proofs, this book is a far more accessible introduction to Itô calculus than most texts. Students, practitioners and researchers will benefit from its rigorous, but unfussy, approach to technical issues. Solutions to the exercises are available online.},

	abstract = {The Black–Scholes option pricing model is the first and by far the best-known continuous-time mathematical model used in mathematical finance. Here, it provides a sufficiently complex, yet tractable, testbed for exploring the basic methodology of option pricing. The discussion of extended markets, the careful attention paid to the requirements for admissible trading strategies, the development of pricing formulae for many widely traded instruments and the additional complications offered by multi-stock models will appeal to a wide class of instructors. Students, practitioners and researchers alike will benefit from the book's rigorous, but unfussy, approach to technical issues. It highlights potential pitfalls, gives clear motivation for results and techniques and includes carefully chosen examples and exercises, all of which make it suitable for self-study.},

Assuming only some calculus and linear algebra, the text develops key results of measure and integration, which are applied to probability spaces and random variables, culminating in central limit theory. Consequently it provides essential prerequisites to graduate-level study of modern finance and, more generally, to the study of stochastic processes. Results are proved carefully and the key concepts are motivated by concrete examples drawn from financial market models. Students can test their understanding through the large number of exercises and worked examples that are integral to the text.},

@inproceedings{dupire_pricing_1994,
	title = {Pricing with a {Smile}},
	abstract = {prices as a function of volatility. If an option price is given by the market we can invert this relationship to get the implied volatility. If the model were perfect, this implied value would be the same for all option market prices, but reality shows this is not the case. Implied Black–Scholes volatilities strongly depend on the maturity and the strike of the European option under scrutiny. If the implied volatilities of at-the-money (ATM) options on the Nikkei 225 index are 20\% for a maturity of six months and 18\% for a maturity of one year, we are in the uncomfortable position of assuming that the Nikkei oscillates with a constant volatility of 20\% for six months but also oscillates with a constant volatility of 18\% for one year. It is easy to solve this paradox by allowing volatility to be timedependent, as Merton did (see Merton, 1973). The Nikkei would first exhibit an instantaneous volatility of 20\% and subsequently a lower one, computed by a forward relationship to accommodate the one-year volatility. We now have a single process, compatible with the two option prices. From the term structure of implied volatilities we can infer a time-dependent instantaneous volatility, because the former is the quadratic mean of the latter. The spot process S is then governed by the following stochastic differential equation:},
